When I was six my uncles used a jigsaw on a Santa Cruz skateboard to make it a mini so I could skate. The next chapter happened around the summer of 1999 in Lowell Massachusetts. A highway barrier company installed 4 prefab skateparks; Hadley park was about a mile from my house and that’s when I really started to skate everyday and met my best friends like Manny Santiago. Boston was only 45 minutes away so we’d skate the city any chance we got. How did you \u001frst become interested in web 3 technology and what led you to incorporate it into your skate project? I had been investing in crypto since 2019 and I kept hearing about NFTS. But it wasn’t until early 2021 I was listening to @kev- inrose & @iamDCinvestor talking about NFTs on A Modern Finance and I participated in helping to raise money for Ukraine. In 30 seconds they raised 1 million dollars. That was powerful. It was then I knew I was in the right place with the most creative people. It was amazing to see all these di\u001eerent art forms come together. I quickly realized I could connect all the dots with skateboarding Shapethree (my recycling skateboard company) & what I was \u001flming on a drone. I wanted to connect the digital NFT space to the physical world. I’ve always had the dream to build some- thing next to Manny Santiago in Puerto Rico so a goal of mine is to build a storage container tiny home with a skate-able pool. This is not an airbnb it’s a hidden gem for skaters involved in any of the collections my family and the collectors of what I’m creating. It’s a dream project to put all the pieces together. I’ve been saving boards from the skaters to incorporate them into the house. I don't want to promise anything to anyone but that’s my long term vision. What inspired you to create a skate project that incorporates web 3 technology and what are some of the unique features that set it apart from traditional skateboarding content? As skateboarders we are constantly in front of camera with a \u001fsheye. That’s how the last 30 years of skateboarding has been documented. When I purchased a drone 6 years ago I was instantly inspired by the wildly di\u001eerent perspective. I live in Southern California and all the local parks are full of transition & pools. I was camping in Idyllwild and got the idea to shoot my friends skating a line and make it loop forever. Every pool is a di\u001eerent shape and set in a di\u001eerent landscape so I knew it would look amazing. It took a lot of trial and error to \u001fgure out the editing to loop the line but shout out to Steve Caballero for making the \u001frst one happen! When I \u001fnished editing that \u001frst pool line to loop endlessly I was calling all the friends to get out and \u001flm. It’s a new way to get skaters supported and to make something eye catching out of what we are already doing. That was the begin- ning of Roll Forever. How do you think web 3 technology is changing the way we consume and interact with skateboarding content and what new opportunities does it present for skaters and fans? It’s the future. Web3 is going to open up a whole new opportunity for \u001flmers and photographers to get supported worldwide. You can instantly reward your original supporters with things like airdrops physical redeemables access to token gated chats or events and updates before it goes to social. I’ve witnessed \u001flmers putting in endless hours to make a full length video and they don’t see any \u001fnancials from it. It’s all for the love skateboarding. I’m looking forward to seeing all the di\u001eerent approaches that will come from local skate videos. The crews like Shep dawgs Static Boondoggle & Skaterats…it’s going to be epic. I’ll be in the front row ready to support.

Releasing the Roll Forever collection was a huge learning experience. I thought the best way to get everyone involved into what I was creating was to release this collection as a randomized mint with 30 videos fractionalized at .1 ETH. After 7 days of the public sale being open and all the promotion that the skaters did 18 videos were minted. I believed that more skaters would be interested to join in the space but that wasn’t the case. With over 1400 videos available after the \u001frst week so I turn o\u001e the minting capabilities. My goal is to bring the most value to both the supporters of the project and the skaters involved. Since there were 18 holders I decided that the best way was to re-release the collection with 1/1s with a total of 100 pools. I \u001fnished editing 50 pool lines and let the originally collectors choose what video they wanted from the Roll Forever collection. Before I released the collection I wanted more skaters to get involved so I ran a photo of Erick Winkowski in the June issue of Thrasher. It had a QR code where e you could learn how to set up a wallet and claim the photo for free for a month. I had 32 pool lines ready to be released and I was trying to \u001fgure out how to price them. It was GoSkateboarding day and I was in a New York theatre listening to @chikaico @GuyNorcal talk about how they were supporting artists that had auctions starting at 0. The idea blew me away; those endless hours of editing and working on this collection for over 2 years could be worth $15 but the concept of letting the world decide its price was just too rad! My best friend that I grew up skating with Manny Santiago our favorite number is 4 and September 12th 2022 — 10-12-22 equaled 44. That determined the release date for the Roll Forever collection. My uncles gave me my \u001frst skateboard and I owe my career in part to them so it only felt right to release this collection with their lines. I had no idea what to expect but the last 30 minutes of the \u001frst auction turned into a bidding battle and @tylerxhobbs won the Roll Forever genesis! I’ll never forget that moment of sitting at the computer watching the auction get pushed back with each bid and seeing that auction coming to a close. I’m beyond grateful for his support and everyone that participated. Each week I slowly rolled out the auctions and it somehow aligned that 50th video with Steve Alba at auction happened to be exactly 100 days from the \u001frst auction! Now that I’m halfway through the collection I’m going to take the next couple of years to travel and \u001flm at the most eye catching of places. Since the start it’s important to me to have skateboarders that have paved the path of skateboarding history and the best of this generation involved in this collection. I’m in no rush to get the next 50 videos done. There are so many amazing skaters out there and I want to take my time to do it right. How have you incorporated community engagement into your web 3 skate project and what role do your fans and supporters play in shaping its direction? 2 months ago I went though every tweet I posted for Roll Forever and anyone that RT I sent them a message thanking them and sent them stickers if they wanted. Down to the little things that people do I want them to be noticed. I’ll never forget ThankYo- uX vouching for Roll Forever on a SuperChief twitter comment and that got Nate skating the nude bowl playing on a billboard throughout Tokyo for a week. I’m forever grateful for these kind of moments. Behind the scenes I’m navigating all the roles myself. From the skaters involved collectors and anyone that has shared what were creating is helping to push skateboarding to the forefront of web3.

Probably that re-release and halting the minting process. That was a huge lesson learned. But also the editing process. It was a lot more challenging that I had anticipated. One line I was working on for honestly 48 hours and it didn’t even align on the cross fade. It won’t make it in Roll Forever but it will be released in the Fakie Files as an edition. When editing these clips it’s a lot of trial and error because there are so many moving parts. I also think a big challenge is there are so many social platforms and each one has a di\u001eerent way to be used with the algorithm. How do you see the intersection of skateboarding and technology evolving in the coming years and what role do you hope to play in shaping that future? I have a few ideas & some I can’t share quite yet :) but I believe the most common thread will be skaters and brands creating digital membership passes. I imagine the next upcoming skater that doesn’t have the support from sponsors and can’t get funding to travel to a contest. They’ll create a digital pass and in the contract it will have 2% of his contest winnings from that year sent to a treasury where it’s claimable for the collectors holding that pass. Web3 creates an outlet for anyone in the world to support. There’s going to be so much innovation and opportunities. I’m excited for the future of this! What advice would you give to aspiring skateboarders and creators who are interested in exploring web 3 technology and its potential for skateboarding? Join in the mix through Discord & Twitter. 90kids GnarsDAO Rug Radio ABD collectables and Roll Forever. It’s a solid start to get involved in the space with other skaters and learn what it’s all about. - Setup a MetaMask - transfer $ to your digital wallet.

I’m excited to be incorporating di\u001eerent types of dynamic pieces into my collections. I recently \u001flmed a pool line of my friend during the day and the exact same line at night. This video being displayed is going to automatically switch from day and night depending on the time of day. Remember that question from above — what new opportunities does it present for skaters and fans? I’ll be creating the 1st ever on chain ** !! I’m so stoked for the future of this web3 and this format to bring everyone together. It’s gonna be epic!

His name was Skater Rat and he was the baddest sneakiest and most mischievous mascot you'd ever seen. Skater Rat was born in the '90s the golden age of skateboarding. He loved nothing more than cruising around the city on his skateboard grinding on rails and doing tricks that would make your head spin. But Skater Rat had a dark side - he had a penchant for stealing money espe- cially from unsuspecting tourists. One day a group of tourists were wandering around the city marveling at the bright lights and the vibrant culture. They were taking pictures and having a great time when suddenly Skater Rat swooped in on his skateboard snatched their wallets and disappeared into the night. The tourists were left stunned and bewildered wondering what had just happened. Skater Rat wasn't just a thief though. He was also a master of disguise. He would often dress up in di\u001eer- ent costumes to throw o\u001e the authorities who were constantly on the lookout for him. Sometimes he would dress up as a tennis ball other times as a street performer and once he even dressed up as an alien spaceship. Despite his sneaky ways Skater Rat had a certain charm that made him popular among the locals. They admired his skateboarding skills and his devil-may-care attitude. Even the police o\u001dcers who were trying to catch him couldn't help but admire his cunning and resourcefulness. One day Skater Rat decided to pull o\u001e his biggest heist yet. He had heard about a museum that was exhibiting a priceless diamond and he knew he had to have it. So he hatched a plan to sneak into the museum and steal the diamond all while dressed up as a janitor. Skater Rat managed to slip past the security guards and make his way to the diamond exhibit. He carefully lifted the glass case and took out the diamond. But just as he was about to make his escape he was confronted by a police o\u001dcer. Skater Rat tried to make a run for it but the o\u001dcer chased him down and tackled him to the ground. Skater Rat was caught red-handed and he knew he was in trouble. But just as the o\u001dcer was about to handcu\u001e him Skater Rat unleashed his secret weapon - a smoke bomb that he had hidden in his skateboard. The smoke bomb exploded creating a thick cloud of smoke that engulfed the museum. Skater Rat used the chaos to his advantage and slipped out of the museum unnoticed diamond in hand. He rode o\u001e into the night on his skateboard laughing all the way. And so Skater Rat became a legend in Neonville. Some saw him as a hero others as a villain but everyone agreed that he was one of a kind. To this day nobody knows what happened to Skater Rat or where he went. But one thing's for sure - his legacy lives on and he will always be remembered as the baddest sneakiest and most skateboardingest mascot of them all.pic!
